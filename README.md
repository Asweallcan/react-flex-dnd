# react-flex-dnd

**React drag and drop sort support flex layout and nested.**

**This package using hooks, note that your React version is above 16.8 :)**

Why flex? flex covers most demands, like list vertically or horizontally, if your list can wrap, that's the problem what here to solve. Flex wrap is likely a grid layout, but there is difference.

**Flex wrap layout, just like using css property flex wrap.**

Grid layout, it uses all spaces to place elements.
